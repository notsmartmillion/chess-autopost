Hi everyone. This time, once again, we'll have an immortal pawn game. Frank Marshall, one of the strongest chess players in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century, is playing white in this game, and he made a total of 14 pawn moves. And let's see what came out of it. His opponent with the black pieces is Hyman Rogosen. The game was played in 1940 in New York. So Frank starts the game with e4, seizing space in the black replies with c5, the Sicilian defense. White can choose practically any development plan: bring out the knights or go c3 with the idea of d4. Strike immediately with d4 in the center. Bring out the bishop to the long dark diagonal or bring out the light-squared bishop. But Frank decides to play as creatively as possible.

He goes b4, sacrificing his pawn on the second move. We get the wing gambit. White sacrifices the pawn on b4 so that after it's taken, they can play d4 or a3 and continue developing their pieces, gaining the initiative while black wastes time gobbling up. White also threatens to take the pawn on c5. Black, of course, could play d5, a counter-strike, sacrificing their pawn on c5. But in this game, black decides to play as principled as possible and takes the offered pawn on b4. White sacrifices yet another pawn. Black refuses. But let's see what would happen if Black took it. For example, the game could go like this: White seizes the center, Black plays d6, bishop d3, knight f6. White achieves maximum development in the shortest possible time and controls the center with pawns.

After finishing development, they can calmly play a3, remain down a but with very active piece play and a central pawn duo. In this actual game, however, Black didn't dare take the pawn on a3 and instead plays knight c6. First of all, this defends the pawn on b4 if needed and also develops a And by the way, strangely enough, the line with a3 and a pawn sacrifice for White is called. the Marshall variation named after Frank Marshall himself. In this position, Frank takes the pawn on b4, and black, in principle, could recapture this. But they apparently decide to try and trap white. They play knight f6, going for maximum provocation. And now, two of black's pieces are already developed. Both pawns on e4 and b4 are under attack. But white finds the move b5.

Black has no time to take the. Their knight is under threat. The knight goes to d4. Going to e5 wasn't as good since there could follow d4 and later e5, chasing away all the black's knights. Continue to provoke white into advancing pawns. White plays c3. And after the Knight retreats to e6. e5 chasing the knight from f6. It seems that white is creating weaknesses in their own position by pushing pawns. But the advance continues. The pawn goes to c4. The knight on d5 is forced to retreat again. And here black should have cooled their ambitions just a. Of course, knight b6 or knight c7 would have looked better. The player with the black pieces needed to stop. But instead, plays knight f4. The knight is now going completely the wrong way.

White makes their ninth pawn move in this game, attacking the knight. And the knight is forced to retreat to the only available square, g6. If it had gone to d3, it would have. been captured by white's. The knight retreats to g6, and f4 now threatens the terrifying move f5, forking both of black's knights at once. What makes the situation worse is the strange placement of the black knights: the one on g6 and the one on e6. In a normal chess game, they almost never end up like this. And for good reason. From these squares, they control the position very poorly. For example, the knight on g6 cannot retreat anywhere; f8 and h8 are blocked by its own pieces, while the knight on e6 is blocked by the pieces on f8 and the queen on d8.

Black could have moved their knight to c7, but they decide not to, since after knight c7 they would face d4. And just look at this white pawn center! The move f5 is threatening, trapping the knight on g6. But nobody wants to end up in such a cramped position. So black decides to go for the most radical option: They take on f4 with a knight, sacrificing a piece. Actually, this move isn't the worst, considering the menace of the white pawns. White recaptures with the pawn on f4, and black captures on f4 with the other knight, getting two pawns for the sacrificed piece, but failing to stop the central pawn advance. White plays d4, already the 12th pawn move in this game. The bishop on c1 is opened. The knight on f4 is once again under attack.

And it retreats to g6. It could also have gone to e6, but then d5 would follow with further pawn advances. In this position, white keeps pushing forward: h4. Another pawn marches ahead with the same idea to trap that knight on f4, which would have no retreat. Black is almost forced to play e6 so they can retreat the knight to e7. And after h5, the black knight is under attack. Black plays rather interestingly. In between, they give a check with the bishop on b4. If the knight had gone straight back to e7, the black bishop would never have gotten into the game. Here, the bishop comes out. White offers a trade. Bishop goes to d2, capture, recapture. And it turns out that the move bishop b4 was actually a.

Now, when the black knight retreats to e7, white has already developed their own knight. Thanks to the capture on d2, it jumps to e4, heading for the weak d6 square. Just try to chase this knight away from d6 later. Black plays knight f5, taking control over d6, so that in case of a check, they can exchange knights. Frank Marshall keeps up the pressure; h6 is by far the strongest move in this position. And this pawn offered by white absolutely cannot be. If, for example, it's captured with the knight on h6, then comes knight d6 check. And after the king retreats, white sacrifices the rook. on h6 for the knight. The capture must be made, and then the queen jumps to h5, threatening mate on f7. If black tries to defend, the queen invades the dark squares.

The queen takes the pawn on h6, and after the king steps back, the white rook joins in along the third rank. There's simply no defense for mate for the black king. And if it's taken, for example, with the then black no longer controls the f6 square with their pawn. The knight jumps to f6, and after king e7, queen f3. And just look at this position. It's black's move, but almost none of their pieces can move. The rook on b8 can't leave; white would take the pawn on a7.

The pawn on b5 is defended. by the bishop on f1, and that's why this pawn simply cannot be. Absolutely cannot. Black is forced to play g6, at least to avoid opening the g file towards their king. The white knight, in any case, lands on f6. The king retreats to f8, and white brings yet another piece into the attack: d6. Black is desperately trying to destroy white's pawn center. Only white doesn't even react to that. They place the knight on g5, getting two mighty knights on f6 and g5. Black trades pawns on d6, and after the recapture, they manage to trade queens. The rook takes on d1, but life for black remains just as The knights completely paralyze black's There's a threat.

Of the rook coming to d8 and taking the rook on h8, the king will have only one escape square, e7, because the pawn on a6 closes all the dark squares for it. The only move black has to defend is king e7, blocking their own rook's action. Now the white rook can't immediately invade, so white brings another rook into the fight along the third rank. The white king feels perfectly safe in the center, which you can't say about the black king. The knight on f5 has no moves; all squares are controlled by white's pieces. The bishop on c8 has no prospects at all, and eventually, even that bishop will be lost. Black finds some move, b6, to at least stay in.

the In this position, Frank Marshall develops his last inactive piece, the bishop from f1 to g2, attacking the But he actually had a more interesting option here. In this position, he could have played rook h to d3, leading to an unavoidable mate in five moves for the black king. There's no defense for If black plays bishop b7, developing a piece and connecting the rook, then rook d7, and that's mate in two moves. King f8, rook takes on f7. White's knights perfectly support the attack, covering all the squares around the black king. If instead black stands still and takes the now undefended pawn on a6 with the knight, then after this capture comes knight takes on h7, and white takes away the crucial escape square f8 from the black king.

If black decides to sacrifice the rook so the king can run to f8, then rook d8. We don't let the king escape anywhere. Rook e8 is mate in one threat. Rook h8 is the only defense. We sacrifice the rook, delaying mate, but after capture and recapture, mate still comes on d8. If they try to bring the bishop out to defend, then rook d7, and we get this beautiful back rank mate. But as I already said, unfortunately, Frank didn't find this line. Instead, he played bishop g2. Of course, this move doesn't spoil anything. Marshall spots the idea of mating along the d file and first captures on h7 with the knight taking away the f8 square from the black king. In this position, black simply resigns. They understand they have absolutely nothing to oppose to white's.

All their pieces have no future while white is ready to deliver mate. In this position, black could have offered a rook exchange on d8. White's rook comes to d3. The king retreats to e7, knight g8 check. Once again, the only escape square for the king is e8. Then the knight returns to f6 and after king f8, black receives mate on the back rank. The pawn on g7 is covered by the pawn on a6 and the knight on g8 perfectly controls e7. That's how The game could have ended, but Black resigned earlier. In the end, the game for White was a complete success. They managed to make 14 pawn moves in the opening and punish their opponent for their knight's constant jumping around. Thanks for watching!
